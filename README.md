# RockPaperScissors
second year project oop cpp
FVF IS DONE :D

PVP:

Chen: 
1. placement:
1.1 identify piece
1.2 make sure that placement is correct
2. move:
2.1 make necessary checks

Fakhri:
1. fix counter (board)
2. get parameters from console:
2.1 create board
2.2 fix the issue with the board recognition. 


**we might need to change the architecture of the code a little, logically it doesnt make sence for the board to hold the players (we can do that after we make the changes and everything works fine).
